# Foundations-of-Data-Analysis-Part-1-

This introductory course explains how to perform basic descriptive analysis in R and how to perform univariate and bivariate analysis on continuous and categorical data, as well as how to perform linear, exponential and logistic functions. The contents for each week are as follows:

Week 1 - Introduction to Data (How to index, create objects and variables and how to perform basic counts).

Week 2 - Univariate Data Analysis (How to create basic bar plots and histograms, how to calculate averages, measures of spread and a five number summary, how to pull out specific data and variables and how to calculate z-scores). 

Week 3 - Bivariate Distributions (Code to produce a scatterplot of two variables and to add a line of best fit. Also, code to calculate the correlation between two variables and code to create a correlation matrix between three variables).

Week 4 - Bivariate Distributions - Categorical Variables (XXXX)
