# Foundations-of-Data-Analysis-Part-1-

This introductory course explains how to perform basic descriptive analysis in R and how to perform univariate and bivariate analysis on continuous and categorical data, as well as how to perform linear, exponential and logistic functions. The contents for each week are as follows:

Week 1 - Introduction to Data (How to index, create objects and variables and how to perform basic counts).

Week 2 - Univariate Data Analysis (How to create basic bar plots and histograms, how to calculate averages, measures of spread and a five number summary, how to pull out specific data and variables and how to calculate z-scores). 

Week 3 - Bivariate Distributions (Code to produce a scatterplot of two variables and to add a line of best fit. Also, code to calculate the correlation between two variables and code to create a correlation matrix between three variables).

Week 4 - Bivariate Distributions - Categorical Variables (Code to create contingency tables, proportion tables and tables of marginal distribution, as well as how to create stacked bar charts and mosaic plots. Also, code to determine probabilities of events occuring given the tables previously created). 

Week 5 - Linear Functions (Code to run linear regression analysis and how to change markers on scatterplots).

Week 6 - Exponential and Logistic Functions (Code to pull out data, start a time series at zero, create a scatterplot showing change over time. Also, code to fit linear, exponential and logistical models to data and code to predict forecasted values after a designated period of time).
